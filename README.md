# Introduction to Java Programming with IntelliJ
Welcome to the Introduction to Java Programming with IntelliJ guide! This README file will provide you with a brief overview of how to get started with Java programming using IntelliJ, one of the popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for Java.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, please ensure that you have the following:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Oracle website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html

IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition or Ultimate Edition installed on your machine. You can download it from the official IntelliJ IDEA website: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download

## Setting up the Project
Launch IntelliJ IDEA on your machine.

Click on "Create New Project" or go to "File" > "New" > "Project".

In the "New Project" window, select "Java" from the left-hand menu.

Choose the JDK version you have installed and click "Next".

Configure the project name and location. You can also specify the project SDK if it is not automatically detected.

Click "Finish" to create the project.

## Creating a Java Class
Right-click on the "src" folder in your project structure and select "New" > "Java Class".

Provide a name for your class and click "OK".

IntelliJ will generate a new Java class file with a basic template containing a main method.

You can start writing your Java code inside the main method.

## Running the Java Program
To run your Java program, right-click anywhere inside the main method and select "Run <your class name>.main()".

Alternatively, you can click on the green arrow icon next to the main method.

IntelliJ will compile your code and execute the program, and you will see the output in the Run window at the bottom of the IDE.

## Debugging the Java Program
To debug your Java program, set breakpoints by clicking in the left margin of the code editor or pressing Ctrl + F8.

Run your program in debug mode by selecting "Debug <your class name>.main()" or clicking on the bug icon next to the main method.

IntelliJ will pause the program execution at the breakpoints, allowing you to inspect variables, step through code, and analyze the program flow.
